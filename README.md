# AskMax-iOS
Ask Max is a mobile application for finding individual room locations, and possibly parking, food, and restrooms, 
at University of Washington - Tacoma. This app is the brainchild of UWT proffessor Ernest Hughes, and the idea also
spawned the creation of the UWT Student Engineers student organization at UWT. UWTSE is a group of current and past 
UW students interested or enrolled in Computer Science who want to collaborate on the development of a range software.
Currently, UWTSE have four software/hardware projects in progress: Ask Max, Tennis Anyone?, Sensor Monkeys, and Free Magic.
